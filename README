DisableMassAssignment
=====================

This plugin sets attr_accessible to nil on the ActiveRecord::Base object, thus disabling mass assignment by default.

In each of your ActiveRecord models you will need to declare which attributes can be mass assigned by using attr_accessible.

Example
=======

attr_accessible :email, :first_name, :last_name
